v0.7.4  2025-10-06

        [Fixes]
        - Fix default templates to use body_open and body_close blocks
          instead of the outdated pre_body references.

        [Changes]
        - Minima::View::HTML: normalize extensions in add_body_open()
          and add_body_close() so configured defaults (e.g. .ht) are
          applied consistently. Added corresponding test coverage.

v0.7.3  2025-10-04

        [Fixes]
        - Fix Static root path in app.psgi template. The middleware now
          correctly points to _static/_ instead of using the obsolete
          `$Dir` variable.

        [Changes]
        - Adjust indentation in the generated main.css template for
          consistency with style conventions.

v0.7.2  2025-10-03

        [Changes]
        - Minima::View::HTML: make add_directory() prepend include paths
          so newly added directories take precedence. Expanded tests  to
          cover this and custom list order.
        - Minima::Router docs: note that controller prefix can also be
          set via the `controller_prefix` config key when using
          Minima::App.

v0.7.1  2025-09-25

        [Fixes]
        - Work around Perl 5.42 segfault in two-variable for loops
          (https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/23405). In
          Minima::Controller::trimmed_params, `$params->flatten` is now
          stored in a temporary array before iteration, avoiding the
          core bug while preserving behavior.
        - Simplify setup test: t/52-setup-from-psgi.t no longer
          overrides CORE::GLOBAL::caller, which caused errors on Perl
          5.42. Instead, it now creates a temporary directory with a
          dummy app.psgi and base.pl to simulate real setup usage.
        - Remove temporary custom ACTION_install from Build.PL. This was
          only used to clean up an obsolete template file left by older
          releases. With the file no longer shipped, the extra build
          step is unnecessary and created an unintended configure-time
          dependency on Path::Tiny and File::ShareDir.

v0.7.0  2025-09-24

        [Changes]
        - Add helper method `json_body` to Minima::Controller to decode
          JSON request bodies.
        - Make cpanfile optional in `minima new`. New projects no longer
          include a cpanfile by default; pass `--cpanfile` to generate
          one.

        [Fixes]
        - Remove obsolete content-type setting from controller template;
          views now handle response preparation.

v0.6.2  2025-09-21

        [Changes]
        - Customize build action to remove obsolete templates.

        [Fixes]
        - Fix template using deprecated methods.

v0.6.0  2025-09-13

        [Changes]
        - Add YAML configuration file support alongside the existing
          .pl format, with automatic detection.
        - Add controller lifecycle hooks, allowing short-circuit
          execution and other customizations.
        - Add method for trimming parameters in Controller.
        - Refactor Minima::View::HTML internals with improved template
          sequencing, clearer structural separation, and new convenience
          methods.
        - Separate combined --listen option for greater flexibility and
          control in minima(1).

        [Fixes]
        - Fix template extension bug that caused templates to fail to
          render.
        - Fix incomplete mention of extensions in documentation.

        - Detect application root from .psgi file location.
        - Paths are now resolved relative to the application
          base directory.
        - New path method in Minima::App for path resolution.
        - Add ability to customize controller prefixes with
          set_prefix method.
        - Add configuration key for controller prefixes.

        [Fixes]
        - Fix outdated and broken rendering in print_env method.

v0.4.1  2024-11-21

        [Fixes]
        - Missing required module in cpanfile.

        [Changes]
        - Added a view for generating JSON responses.
        - Added a view for generating plain text responses.
        - Views can now modify Plack::Responses to configure them as
          needed.
        - Introduced a dedicated setup subroutine, enabling delayed
          initialization rather than compile-time setup.
        - The main package now includes a default starting point,
          reducing the amount of required setup code.

        [Fixes]
        - HTML view is now a descendant of the base view class.
        - Corrected typos in the documentation.

v0.3.0  2024-11-11

          HEAD requests.
        - Add support to a default data hash in Minima::View::HTML.

        [Fixes]
        - Version option not working in bin/minima.
        - Minima::Router's clear_routes would not remove special routes.

          Minima::View::HTML.
